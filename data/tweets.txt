Iran is closing the Strait of Hormuz for a military exercise. Imagine what they will do with nukes?!
The Mullahs laughed when @BarackObama "asked" Iran to return our drone--they will show it to China first.

He ruins the brand: @Robe"If "The AMeeting Former Speaker Newt Gingrich next week. On the Agenda---defeating @BarackObama.
He ruins the brand: @bobbeckel doesn't belong on @FoxNews. As CM for Mondale in '84, you lost 49 states. Sad!
Iran will soon take all of the oil in Iraq...and Iraq itself---Keep the oil.
As of September 30th, we have a record trade deficit with China of over $217Billion. They are ripping us off. #TimeToGetTough
Yesterday @BarackObama actually spent a full day in Washington. He didn't campaign, fund raise or play golf. Shocking.
The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP. Very disappointing.
ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces. It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency.
Why is @BarackObama delaying the sale of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan? Wrong message to send to China. #TimeToGetTough
My new book, Time To Get Tough, comes out on December 5th. Pre-order on Amazon.com. It's the best book I've ever written.
October has a 7% foreclosure increase last month. Is this @BarackObama’s economic recovery?
2012 is the most impoTo the brave men and women, past and present, in our armed services- best wishes on Veterans Day.
The Arab Spring has turned into the Islamist Winter. Our ally @Israel is in a perilous position. We must stand behind @Israel.
The Fed should not bail out the EU. Europe's financial mess is their problem, not our problem!
Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem.
Malfeasance at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped cause our current financial meltdown.
The economy won't fully recover until @ObamaCare is fully repealed. It is a job killer!
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza. Why did @BarackObama promote the "Arab Spring"?
The Al Qaeda flag is now flying over Benghazi. @BarackObama spent over $3Billion of our money for this?
ObamaCare contains marriage penalty taxes. Why should married couples be penalized for having healthcare?
Our worst threat to unemployment is @ObamaCare. It will also destroy our country's basic standards.
When will our nation's sacrifices be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil.
The Debt is our nation's greatest threat. @BarackObama is out of touch.
Why aren't we getting any oil from Iraq before we leave? We are leaving the country wide open for Iran. Big mistake.
I am happy to see the majority of the GOP candidates agree with me that the tax code must be simplified and the rates dropped.
Does @BarackObama ever work? He is constantly campaigning and fundraising--on both the taxpayer's dime and time---not fair!
The job plan by @BarackObama is nothing more than a second stimulus. The first failed and so will this one.
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
Bob Beckel, a commentator for FOX is bad for the @FoxNews brand: @BobBeckel is close to incompetent.
My beautiful wife Melania will be appearing on QVC this evening from 8 to 9 pm.
Both @BarackObama and China have embraced OWS. All want the decline of America. Time for the protesters to go home.
Everyone makes mistakes, but it's what you do with them and what you learn from them that matters." -- Midas Touch
Iraq's government is treating us like fools. We should demand their oil.
If ObamaCare is not repealed then we can expect stagnant growth, long term unemployment and record high premiums.
It is time for Iran to face serious consequences. This regime is a threat to our national security.
Late last Friday @BarackObama announced his 2011 budget deficit was $1.299 trillion -- the second largest in US history.
Happy to have passed 800,000 followers. Looking forward to passing 1M sooner than later.

Mitt Romney is right about the Chinese rip-off of America.
The debate was very interesting last night. There were numerous winners and Governor Romney did very well.
When will @BarackObama release an actual budget?
I don't want to be the only billionaire in America---I want all Americans to be rich.
If the Prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people---not liberal intellectuals.
The only way to spread economic growth is to lower taxes and end unfriendly regulatory practices.
The Fed's reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation.
New study shows 80% of Congress have no business experience--it shows!
A guy named @BobBeckel on FOX, their resident liberal, was not born with much of a brain.
When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first.
The GOP primary schedule is a disaster. Not enough time.
The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. Huge mistake. Cut wasteful spending first.

Obama Care’s taxes vest in 2014. Conveniently after the 2012 election. Coincidence?
OPEC is ripping us off on oil. We are ripping ourselves off by investing in unproven green energy. #Solyndra
Our deficit spending is China’s gain. @BarackObama is bankrupting our country.
Australia is a beautiful country with terrific people who love America.
China is neither an ally or a friend--they want to beat us and own our country.
Our next President must stop China's Rip-off of America.
ObamaCare will destroy small business--the backbone of America's economy.
"If you're going to think--think big" --- The ASorry I will miss the CPAC gathering in Orlando--there in spirit--Obama must go.
It seems there is never a problem for which @BarackObama cannot find a reason for another speech and another tax.
How will raising taxes create jobs? Washington is all out of answers. New leadership is needed.
I applaud @netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the UN to defend @Israel. A true US friend and great leader.
We can create jobs in the American economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector.

Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate. Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US. America will boom.
I watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs.
Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program? The US should look at future funding.
China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion. @BarackObama is their favorite client.
If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record.
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare---not cuts on Seniors.
Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama.
Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now.
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?
China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership, it can be stopped.
We have spent over $1 Billion on the Libya operation. What are we getting back?
Let's not staWe spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil?
We don't need another stimulus. The first one was a complete failure. Why repeat the same mistake?

Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently. They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens.
Insurgents in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks---US wastes trillions.
Ron Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Unemployment is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths. Very troubling.
Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy.

How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island & Long Island.
We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!

Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy. How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
President Obama missed the deadline!

So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
Ale@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But, he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will.
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.

My announcement is tomorrow!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!

I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
"Via @politico: "Donald Trump claims Barack Obama bombshell" Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday.
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.

Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!
They succeed, because they think they can." -- Virgil
Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic.
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go.
FoGood luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev. Wright disciples go to Washington?" Sad!
Follow @MELANIATRUMP's jewelry line on @QVC site Rev. @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham.
Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney.
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse!
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead. Mitt will pull away next week.
Obama has called Libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal." Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth!
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apaYes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
Congratulations to Bernie Marcus & Herman Cain @JobCreatorsUSA on the #TruthTour2012--All employers need to check this out!
For the truth about job creation in America go to .@lancearmstrong really blew it--went down in flames--too bad!
Obama said "not optimal" to Ambassador & embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate.
With Barry Diller & Tina Brown in charge, did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure?
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team?
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apa@TorresTerrell @BarackObama Thanks!
Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy.
I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays, however.
Robe@darbizman Thanks!
AleAmazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ.
When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years." --@MittRomney
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his staWhile the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board. Mitt will remember the early helpers.
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically.
Great aReally enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
Polls are staObama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
I still love Derek, he is a winner!
Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.
Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!
For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves." -- Thomas Edison
Get ready for tonight!
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
I can confirm the repo.@rupeVerlander is great but very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government." -- @MittRomney
Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by."Donald J. Trump
If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.

Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor.
You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird." -- @MittRomney
I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again.
It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud!
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks...
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly, after the election!
"Donald Trump: ‘Monkey business’ on jobs" George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot.
California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
Greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.

Bill Clinton has been Obama's most effective surrogate out on the trail.
Congrats to @Yankees on finishing 1st in the AL East. Derek Jeter is great--good luck in the playoffs!
I'm eagerly awaiting the next polls. The debate performance could be devastating to the Obama team. Let's see what happens.
Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. You need to stay positive.
Congratulations to Mitt Romney. He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight!

I've learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success." --Jack Welch
Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers.
Republicans and @MittRomney must get tough very soon.
Only 36 days until the election. @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. Make Obama's terrible record the issue. #TimeToGetTough
In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states "born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia.
To be successful your focus has to be broad enough to think big at the same time." --'Midas Touch' with @theRealKiyosaki
My successful acquisition of the Kluge estate was a fantastic deal which is already being studied in business schools.
Be tenacious. Being tenacious means you're tough and patient at once, so it's a formidable combination.
Someone must be fired at @AOL for that stupid deal they made buying Huffington Post.
Congratulations to my friend David Wright of the @mets who is now their all-time hitting leader.

Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail." -- Charles F. Kettering
The debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @MittRomney has proved--in Florida--he delivers under pressure.
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.
Despite all of China's cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race.
Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
The Republican PaWeekly jobless claims are up once again. The economy cannot recover with Obama in office.
Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records & applications in return?

I'll be on @gretawire tonight at 10 PM Fox News
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.
It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
China is now attacking Japan's economy for leverage It's Monday, how many more excuses will Obama make today about the economy?

Hey @KimKardashian--I hear you are undecided in the election. I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
It's amazing--@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. He is a complete shill for Obama.

Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program." -- Milton Friedman
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
Weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary." -- Vince Lombardi

Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel." -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu
It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil.
As bad as they were, I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power.
I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again, I was right.
When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? The day after.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!
There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.

We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion" -- @MittRomney

NoI wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @Late_Show. It's simple--I get the ratings!
Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon, @lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in France?
Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
SmaIs this Hope & Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today...OPEC is having a ball at our expense.
Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck.
I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone!
If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not?
Andy Roddick...a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife.
Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!
I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious. They watch the polls. @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore.
We have all the cards. Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran.

I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.
It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas?
As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines & ratings!
I am sure the @NCGOP will do a great job bracketing the @DNC convention. They are a tremendous statewide organization.
It's Friday. How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.
Florida has been very good to me. I am really esxcited to give back at the Sarasota GOP event and @RNC convention. Will be fun!
Terrible tragedy at the Empire State Building today. Must have fast trials and death penalty for the animals.
I am very surprised that @lancearmstrong gave up. I never thought he was a quitter...
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood President is visiting us next month. @BarackObama is so excited.

To all struggling young entrepreneurs--stay positive in this tough climate and keep looking for good deals. They are out there.

Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of "Buseyisms"!
Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice
For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
“George has a real twinkle about him” says @TheRealMarilu. Really? The shark should be scared. #CelebApprentice
This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice

Re Omarosa: Nasty, tough or smaDoes anyone agree with Marilu that Gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation.

On the whole, the teams seem to be working well together. No wars...yet.

Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $. Looks like a good season for charities.

Lance Armstrong did himself great harm last night. Lawsuits & failure will follow him!
I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself "what was I thinking?
Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice.
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.
IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....
Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco.
Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah. I’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again.

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?
Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.
Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!

It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!

Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!
Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation.
A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!

The main stream media wants to surrender constitutional rights -- I believe #ISIS needs to surrender!
Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apaThe podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good, but the words will be the key.
Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.
So, how did I do on Face The Nation?
Watch Face The Nation - will be on now!
I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A.M. Should be interesting - ENJOY!
Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?

Just got back from South Carolina. Going to Alabama tomorrow!
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he’s almost last.
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.

The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the “B” team. She won’t be so lucky when it comes to me!
#DemDebate was really boring but had a lot of fun live tweeting and picked up by far the most followers.
Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!
Sanders said only black lives matter - wow! Hillary did not answer question!
Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!
Good move by Bernie S.
The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote, e-mails etc.
All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage.
Who is winning the debate so far (just last name)? #DemDebate
O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance.

When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
Arena was packed, totally electric!
John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.
Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
Way to go @serenawilliams - you are a true champion. Proud of you!
Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.

New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #WakeUpAmerica
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Willthe world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats. Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
Thank you for your wonderful endorsement today @TGowdySC. It means a great deal to me. We will not disappoint! #Trump2016
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell. Well delivered and totally logical! @CNN @FoxNews
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker...does nothing to help!
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!
It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning. Enjoy!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Thank you New York, I will never forget!
A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.
Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.
It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.

As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
After all of these years of suffering thru ObamaCare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised!
